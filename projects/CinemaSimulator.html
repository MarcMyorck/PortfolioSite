            Description
          </h4>
          <p>
            My very first VR project in Unity.
          </p>

            Story
          </h4>
          <p>
            You are working in a cinema and giving out food and drinks to the guests.
          </p>
        </section>

        <!-- Gameplay/Features -->

          <h4>
            Gameplay and Features
          </h4>
          <p>
            Customers are coming into the cinema and order random drinks and food via a text above their head. You have to find the correct food and drinks and place them inside the delivery area on the counter. If only the correct items are in the area, the customer leaves and the next one comes in. The items respawn after each order.
          </p>

        <!-- Workflow -->

            Workflow
          </h4>
          <p>
            First, I created the cinema area in which the game is going to take place. After that, I focussed on spawning the customer, making him walk up to the counter, randomizing an order for him and displaying it in a text above his head.
          </p>
          <p>
            The next step was to add the items to the game and making them grabable, before adding the delivery area and making it check the items inside and finishing the orders, if the items are correct. Then I made sure, that the orders are only finished when only the correct items are inside and made them respawn after the order is finished.
          </p>
          <p>
            Finally, I did some cleanup with the customer movement, detailed the area and items more and fixed some things.

          <h4>
            Key takeaways
          </h4>
          <p>
            Developing a VR game is very fun. The grabbing and physics work well out of the box in Unity, much better than I would have though before. The project was not really complicated and was more to just learn how VR development works.

        <!-- What I would do better next time -->
        <section class="project-text-section">
          <h4>
            Improvements
          </h4>
          <p>
            The project is just paused at the moment. I want to add more tasks (Like selling tickets, giving out change etc.) for the player and polish the environment as most objects are just placeholders.
