        <!-- Description (General about project) -->
        <p>
          Description: This was the first game I created and the only analogue game I created so far. In this project my task was to develop an physical game from start to finish. I could choose between a card or board game. I chose a card game and from there on started developing the game world and visuals, developing the mechanics, creating a prototype, testing that prototype with friends, finetuning mechanics and lastly printing and assembling the physical copy of the game with my planned designs. In the end I was quite happy with the results

        <!-- Story -->
        <p>
          Story: The game is set in a fantasy world. You play as a group of dwarf adventures that got stuck in an old mine looking for treasures. You need to use the gear you can find in coordination with your team to defeat enemies and escape the mine.
        </p>

        <!-- Gameplay/Features -->
        <p>
          Gameplay/Features: Your goal is to play your cards in coordination with your team to defeat waves of enemies.

        <!-- What I would do better next time -->
        <p>
          What I would do better next time: Take more time to test and develop the mechanics and balancing. This was hard to do because I also had to do all the other work in the fixed timeframe. I think the game works fine but it can be a bit overwhelming and rough around the edges at times, especially for new players. I would have loved to make the game more beginner friendly as it is supposed to be a relaxing cooperative experience for everyone.

        <!-- Note about documentation request -->
        <p>
          The full course documentation for the game can be requested. However, it is only available in German.
