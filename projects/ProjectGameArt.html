        <!-- Description (General about project) -->
        <p>
          Description: This project was created for my university course "Project: Game Art" over the course of three months. I created this asset completely from scratch in blender and then exported and implemented it into a scene in Unity. 
        </p>

        <!-- Story -->
        <p>
          Story: The asset is an ancient Maya temple, that has been lost in the rainforest. You and your group of archaeologist friend are searching for the lost village in which the temple once stood and try to find out what happened to the village and restore it for the world to see.
