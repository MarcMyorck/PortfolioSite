        <!-- Workflow -->
        <p>
          Workflow: As our other developer had problems with his car and I basically did all of the gameplay programming myself. However, I managed to implement solid gameplay system. I created a input system, that would save the players input and compare them to the inputs shown on screen. Also, I created In the end we added a title screen with menu, a tutorial screen with a video produced by our teammates, added art, music and soundeffects and cleaned everything up.
        </p>

        <!-- Key takeaways -->
        <p>
          Key takeaways: Doing so much alone was a bit though as my knowledge in Unreal Engine was still kind of limited and Unreal Engine is not optimal for 2D games. However I still managed to implement the systems in a way that they work well together. I especially like the way the game conveys information not through simple numbers or letters but graphics and colors. As the result of the Game Jam and my first bigger Unreal Engine project I am proud of the way it turned out.

        <!-- What I would do better next time -->
        <p>
          What I would do better next time: Next time we should choose a better engine for the project as Unity would have probably been easier.

        <p>
          The full course documentation for the game can be requested. However, it is only available in German.
