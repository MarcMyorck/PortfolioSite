        <!-- Workflow -->
        <p>
          Workflow: As our other developer had problems with his car and I basically did all of the gameplay programming myself. It was a bit though as my knowledge in Unreal Engine was still kind of limited and Unreal Engine is not optimal for 2D games. However, I managed to implement a input system. In the end we added a title screen with menu, a tutorial screen with a video produced by our teammates, added art, music and soundeffects and cleaned everything up.
