          <p>
            Sorry, I live here now is a Fast-Paced Action Game in which you stun enemies to take over their bodies and defeat other monsters.

            Story
          </h4>
          <p>
            You are playing as Boof, a small and fragile ghost that takes over enemies to fight other enemies and take back control over the graveyard.

            Gameplay and Features
          </h4>
          <p>
            In this game the player moves the character around a 3D arena and attacks the endlessly spawning enemies to stun them and knock them on the floor. Once they are knocked down, the player can take over their bodies. When he take over their bodies, the player can use their attacks to fully defeat enemies instead of just stunning them. If the player gets hit as an enemy, he returns to being a ghost. At this point the game is just endlessly spawning enemies in one level until the player loses all health as Boof. The environment is made of 2D sprites in a 3D world.

            Workflow
          </h4>
          <p>
            We started by writing all our ideas on a whiteboard and brainstorming. The theme was "Mask" and we brainstormed for a long time about what kind of game to make. In the end we liked the idea of having a weak character that uses a mask-like power to take over enemies, get stronger and use their powers.
          </p>
          <p>
            We were a team of 4 people, 3 artists and me, one of which got sick half-way through the game jam. I did everything in Unity while the others delivered the art assets to me to implement in the engine.

        <!-- Key takeaways -->

          <h4>
            Key takeaways
          </h4>
          <p>
            As I had to implement a lot of art assets into the game, I learned a lot about working with 2D sprites and animations, as well as implementing them into a 3D environment. However that also meant that I had to cut work on finetuning mechanics as we prioritised visual polish and the environment after the core gameplay loop was implemented. Another programmer would have been helpful here. Still I am very happy with the way it turned out and I think we made a very fun little game experience.

            Improvements
          </h4>
          <p>
            Like said before, I would have loved to polish the gameplay a bit more, especially the combat systems, but we would have needed more work force or time for that.
