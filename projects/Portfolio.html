            Story
          </h4>
          <p>
            I needed a professional appearance if I wanted to connect to many people about games. So I made it a project in my free time to create business cards, a logo and a website.

        </section>

            Workflow
          </h4>
          <p>
            First I started with the Logo, for which I first needed to decide for a color. I picked a dark forest green because I like green and I think it looks professional but is still pretty and interesting and it goes well with white and grey which I also wanted to use for a bright and welcoming feel. Then I needed to find imagery. I chose to depict my initials MR and because I am a game developer I wanted to use a controller, because I realized that the shape was similar to an M, and some zeros and ones as code for the R. This combined with the colors led to my finished Logo.
          </p>
          <p>
            Then I created my business cards, which are just my logo on the front and a picture of me with my important information on the back.
          </p>
          <p>
            The biggest chunk of work was definitely creating the website and filling it with all the documentation to the different projects I made. I wanted to do everything by myself so I wrote it from scratch in HTML, CSS and JavaScript, bought the domain and hosted it via GitHub pages.

          <h4>
            Key takeaways
          </h4>
          <p>
            I learned a lot about design and colors, refined my web development, and learned about hosting a website with domain and GitHub pages.
          </p>

        <!-- What I would do better next time -->
        <section class="project-text-section">
          <h4>
            Improvements
          </h4>
          <p>
            This is not finished yet so I plan on keep improving my website, logo and business cards. I want to create a professional but still creative and fun design, that stands out.
