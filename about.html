    <h1>About me</h1>
    <!-- Introduction (Mehr wie Antonia? Focus on Learning (Engines, Programming Languages, Japanese, Accordion etc.) Notiz zusammenfassung, Best of both worlds (2Bachelors) -->
    <p>
      Hello and welcome to my portfolio. My name is Marc Riewe, I am 24 years old and a game developer from Germany, specialising mainly in Game Programming, but also Game Design and QA. I combine my technical experience with my knowledge in Game Design to help create fun and robust gameplay. Through my expertise in Game Design and QA I am able to view requirements from different viewpoints and develop them not only the way they are asked, but the way they make sense and are fun. This is further aided by my logical, strategic and planning approach and motivation to keep on learning new things.
    </p>
    <!-- Game Dev Studies (IU, Work DLR, etc.) -->
    <p>
      I am currently pursuing a Bachelor of Arts degree in Game Design at IU International University at the campus in Cologne, Germany. My goal is to learn as much as possible about game development as possible to be able to create innovative gameplay experiences. My studies allowed me to get to know every part of the process of creating games and apply my knowledge in multiple different projects. During my studies I worked part-time as an UX Engineer in the past and currently in a research project at DLR where i develop a VR application in Unreal Engine as the main engine and gameplay developer.
    </p>
    <!-- Business Informatics Studies and Testing Experience -->
    <p>
      Before starting my current studies I graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Business Informatics at EUFH, which is now part of CBS. During and after this degree I worked in software testing and test automation as part of agile teams for almost 5 years. This equipped me well for working in software development and shaped my interest in Programming and QA. I bring hands-on experience in software development and testing and worked as a part of agile teams.
    </p>
    <!-- Free Time Work (IAB, Game Jams, private Projekte, Sprache, My gaming history) -->
    <p>
      Outside of work and studying I like to work on private projects to mostly refine my skills in game engines and programming languages. I also like participating in game jams with my fellow students or visiting game events like gamescom, where I worked as a volunteer at the Indie Arena Booth every year since 2023, or the Tokyo Game Show in 2025. Other than that I love gaming myself and learning new things. I speak German and English fluent and have been learning Japanese on the side since late 2024.
